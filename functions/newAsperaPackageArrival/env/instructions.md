Inside this directory '/env', create a new file named '.env'

Structure looks like this:

/env 
     |
     |__  .env

Contents of .env file should follow this schema:

AWS_KEY=???
AWS_SECRET=???
ROLE=???



Note:     Never commit the .env file to the repo. 
          '.env' is ignored in .gitignore at the repo's root to prevent a commit.
